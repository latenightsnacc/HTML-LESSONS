            <p>
                MEST Africa, is happy to announce that the application period for its Training Program has been extended until <strong>Friday September 17th, 2021</strong> .
            </p>
            <p>
                Due to the increasing uncertainty around COVID-19 and unconfirmed graduation dates for most Universities across West Africa this year, MEST has confirmed to start the new cohort for its core Training Program in <strong>January 2022</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The extension of the recruitment phase would enable MEST Africa to speak to more talents across the region as they find the next class of innovative technology entrepreneurs.
